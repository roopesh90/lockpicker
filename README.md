Key Combination Generator - LockPicker
------

I have a bike lock, which uses a numeric combination to open like so (flat repesentation):

 ~~~   ~~~   ~~~   ~~~
| 1 | | 1 | | 1 | | 1 | 
 ~~~   ~~~   ~~~   ~~~
| 2 | | 2 | | 2 | | 2 | 
 ~~~   ~~~   ~~~   ~~~
| 3 | | 3 | | 3 | | 3 | 
 ~~~   ~~~   ~~~   ~~~
| 4 | | 4 | | 4 | | 4 | 
 ~~~   ~~~   ~~~   ~~~
| 5 | | 5 | | 5 | | 5 | 
 ~~~   ~~~   ~~~   ~~~
| 6 | | 6 | | 6 | | 6 | 
 ~~~   ~~~   ~~~   ~~~

I lost/misplaced the combination. So since a few days, was trying to find the combination manually and open it. Because, its become mandatory in where I live (Bangalore, India) for pillions to wear helmets, so i have to have a pillion helmet on my Bike.

Hence I came up with an idea, to create a py script to generate the combi's and put a random one on screen as a try. This goes on Till the user unlocks/claims to unlock the lock.

This is a super nob script and requires a HUGE amount of Work :)

If your looking at ths, would love your feedbacks.

Improvements to come:
1. Saving state on used keys, on closing script/un-natural termination
2. Automating script to suite any 4 digit combination lock
3. Automating script to suite any n digit combination lock
4. Making the selection algo smarter
5. Maye be make it self learning. (Spidy sense tingling -> AI, Predictive)
